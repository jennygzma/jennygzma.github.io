            about me
          </h1>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed font-mono">
            Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer, born and raised in SF bay area, but currently based in NYC looking for open roles. Previously, I worked at <strong className="text-light-green">DoorDash </strong> 
            on the Category Expansion team as a <strong className="text-light-green">backend SWE</strong>, working to expand DoorDash to include new verticals 
            such as alcohol, retail, and pharmaceutical goods. I attended <strong className="text-light-green">Princeton University</strong> for undergrad and 
            majored in <strong className="text-light-green">Operations Research and Financial Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong className="text-light-green">computer science</strong>.
            <br/> <br/> For my next role, I'm open to remote, NYC, or SF-based backend engineering, and am also open to full-stack. My main goal is to join a company where
            I am aligned with the product and have opportunity for ownership and impact. Feel free to <a href="mailto:jennygzma@gmail.com" className="text-light-green font-semibold hover:font-bold">[email me] </a> 
            if you want my resume, letters of rec from my previous managers/teammates, or just to chat!
            <br/> <br/> In my spare time, I enjoy writing music, surfing, and hanging out with friends. I also try to run daily but don't really find that enjoyable  ðŸ˜¬
